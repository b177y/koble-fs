Tools and source for building the filesystem used by the
Podman and UML drivers for link:https://github.com/b177y/koble[Koble].

== Overview

This repo contains the source for building the debian buster
filesystem used by Koble.
Buildah is used to create the image,
which is then copied to an ext4 image file for use with netkit.

== Usage

Requirements:

* link:https://github.com/alperakcan/fuse-ext2[fuse-ext2]
* link:https://github.com/containers/buildah[buildah]

To make the OCI (docker/podman) image and UML fs:

[source,sh]
----
make uml-image

== ToDo

* [ ] Add tests
* [ ] Add support for multiple filesystems (e.g. arch, ubuntu, centos, alpine)
* [ ] refactor startup/shutdown scripts
* [ ] Add docs
* [ ] Switch from `make` to `plz` for build system
